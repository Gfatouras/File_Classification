# File Labeling

This repository provides a script that labels files for a supervised machine learning model.

## Overview

The script takes file names and a list of categories, and automatically assigns each file to a category. This effectively labels most of the files, preparing them for a supervised machine learning model that can later be used to automatically sort incoming files based on their content or metadata.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to automate the labeling of a large dataset, making it easier to train machine learning models that can classify files. This process significantly reduces manual effort in preparing data for training.

## Features

- Automatically assigns labels to files based on predefined categories.
- Handles large datasets efficiently (up to 500,000 files).
- Prepares data for training machine learning models for file classification.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gfatouras/File-Labeling-ML-.git
   cd File-Labeling-ML-
